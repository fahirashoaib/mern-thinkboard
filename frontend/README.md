## React + Vite Application

I built this app by watching this [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea9rrRj9e0Y&t=12634s) of channel [codesistency](https://www.codesistency.io/).

## About this React app:
* This app is built using MERN stack in VS code. 
* It is a very basic but helpful app in creating and styling a frontend, dealing with backend, understanding the apis, handelling database and cross orign requests. 
* To create the vite app frontend, use this [guide](https://vite.dev/guide/). 
* [react-hot-toast](https://react-hot-toast.com/) was used for notifications.
* [tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com/) was used for styling
* Use tailwindcss ntellisense extension in case your ide is not getting the code.
* For using icons, this package was installed `npm i lucide-react`
* For testing routes, Postman extension was used.
* [Redis - Upstash](https://upstash.com/) was used for limitting the requests.

## How to build and run:
* First clone this project
* You can now build by running these commands in the terminal in the main folder where both frontend and backend folders are located:
  * `npm run build` This will install all the dependencies and will create the folder named __node_modules__
  * `npm run start` This will start your backend server.
  * You can now test the endpoint.
  * Now, run the frontend by first navigating to this folder using `cd frontend` and run this command:
  * `npm run dev` This will give you the link containing the localhost and its port number on which frontend is displayed.
  * Now you can play around.
* or You can also build this project by separately running these commands in the terminal in both backend and frontend folders separately:
    * `npm install`
    * `npm run dev`
